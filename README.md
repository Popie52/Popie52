# 👋 Hey there, I’m Popie52!

> **"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad." – Cory House**

## 🚀 Who Am I?
Imagine a caffeine-fueled student on a quest to master the web—armed with a keyboard, unbreakable curiosity, and a habit of breaking (then fixing) stuff for fun. I’m Popie52, a fullstack developer who loves turning wild ideas into working code.

## 🧑‍💻 My Superpowers
- **Languages:** JavaScript (React), Python, Java, C++
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Testing:** Playwright (Node), Vitest, E2E
- **Stack:** Anything I can get my hands on—if it compiles, I’ll hack it!

## ⚡ Fun Fact
I debug in more languages than I speak IRL.  
If you hear frantic keyboard clacking, it’s probably me running an E2E test or taming a rogue bug.

## 🛠️ What I’m Building

## 🌐 Let’s Connect!

## 🤓 Always Learning
Whether it’s backend wizardry or pixel-perfect frontend, I’m constantly expanding my toolkit. If you love code experiments, memes, or spontaneous hackathons—let’s talk!
